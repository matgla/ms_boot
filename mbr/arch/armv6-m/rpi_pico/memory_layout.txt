[ 256 B ] -> RPI PICO 2nd stage bootloader  (1) 
[ 126 B ] -> Bootstrap code                 (2) 
[ 32  B ] -> Partition Entry 1 
[ 32  B ] -> Partition Entry 2 
[ 32  B ] -> Partition Entry 3 
[ 32  B ] -> Partition Entry 4 
[ 2   B ] -> Boot signature 0x55aa
= [ 512 B ] 

(1): initializes flash XIP and executes bootstrap code 
(2): bootstrap code searches /boot parition and boot it 
(3): in boot there should be msboot

msboot: 
    -> search valid system parition 
    -> checks if someone is connected via UART/USB/VGA and KEYBOARD
    -> if yes then provide interface to reflash 
    -> provides some basic IO functionality 
    -> boots OS
